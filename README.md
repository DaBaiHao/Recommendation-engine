# Recommendation-engine
## Introduction
Recommendation engine as a subclass of the information filtering system related vast areas for example music, movie, online selling, search engine and so on. The collaborative filtering-based recommendations and content-based recommendations are the ways to generate recommendations. The designed project is to implement these two recommendations algorithms and evaluate the effectiveness.

--- 
## Implement
The designed implementing algorithms is collaborative filtering-based recommendations and content-based recommendations. The target programming language is python. TensorFlow is considered to be used in this project.

--- 
## Data require
To build a recommendation engine, dataset as an important part to evaluate the utility of the recommendations. 
The dataset below can provide some useful data which can be used to evaluate the algorithms.
 - Yahoo! - Movie, Music, and Images Ratings Data Sets: https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=r
 - Spotify - RecSys Challenge 2018 Data Sets: https://recsys-challenge.spotify.com/details
 - Kaggle - Million Song Dataset Challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/c/msdchallenge
 - Datasets For recommender system: http://shuaizhang.tech/2017/03/15/Datasets-For-Recommender-System/

## Evaluate
The designed evaluate methods is to split the data into the training set and the testing set. For more recommdation engine evluatation, more article will be futhure look through.

## New skill Learning
Python, TensorFlow, deep learning, recommdation systems, signal processing, recommdation systems evaluate methods.
