# Recommendation-engine
## Introduction
Recommendation engine as a subclass of the information filtering system related vast areas for example music, movie, online selling, search engine and so on. The collaborative filtering-based recommendations and content-based recommendations are the ways to generate recommendations. The designed project is to implement these two recommendations algorithms and evaluate the effectiveness.

--- 
## Implement
The designed implementing algorithms is collaborative filtering-based recommendations and content-based recommendations. The target programming language is python. TensorFlow is considered to be used in this project.

--- 
## Data require
To build a recommendation engine, dataset as an important part to evaluate the utility of the recommendations. 
The dataset below can provide some useful data which can be used to evaluate the algorithms.
Yahoo! - Movie, Music, and Images Ratings Data Sets: https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=r
Spotify - RecSys Challenge 2018 Data Sets: https://recsys-challenge.spotify.com/details
Kaggle - Million Song Dataset Challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/c/msdchallenge

## Evaluate
The designed evaluate methods is to split the data into the training set and the testing set. For more recommdation engine evluatation, more article will be futhure look through.

## New skill Learning
Python, TensorFlow, deep learning, recommdation systems, signal processing, recommdation systems evaluate methods.
